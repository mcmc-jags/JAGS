 * @short Represents a model described in the BUGS language

 *
 * ParseTree objects form a tree structure in which the parameters of
 * the node are its children.  In order to enforce a valid tree
 * structure certain restrictions are placed on the setParameters
 * function.
 *
 * ParseTree objects are designed to be dynamically allocated. A
 * ParseTree object takes ownership of its parameters and deletes them
 * when it is deleted.  Hence you only need to delete the top-level
 * ParseTree object.
